# GC-CoC-Network

The neural network model of the granular layer with granular cells and Golgi cells.

This is a set of code for the neural network model used in the following paper:

Tang Y, An L, Wang Q, Liu JK. Regulating synchronous oscillations of cerebellar granule cells by different types of inhibition.

When playing the model, one can switch on and off different mechanisms using gate variables in the network.
