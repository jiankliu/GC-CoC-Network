# GC-CoC-Network

The neural network model of the granular layer with granular cells and Golgi cells.

This is a set of code for the neural network model used in the following paper:

Tang Y, An L, Wang Q, Liu JK. Regulating synchronous oscillations of cerebellar granule cells by different types of inhibition. PLoS Comput Biol 17(6): e1009163 (2021) DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009163

When playing the model, one can switch on and off different mechanisms using gate variables in the network.
